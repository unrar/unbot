    Shiva
-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

Shiva is the Testing version of UnBot. Actually, it's written in Python. 
It'll become stable when all the actual features of Sybil are added to Shiva.

Once all the actual Sybil bugs are fixed, its development will be frozen and
we will focus on porting all its features to Shiva. Then, Sybil will become
Hattie (old-stable) and Shiva will become Stable, and a new version will be
testing.

NAMES AFTER FROZENING:

Sybil (stable)   -> Mary (old-stable)
Shiva (unstable) -> Shiva (stable)
( void )         -> Hattie (unstable)
